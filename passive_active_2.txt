% This file contains the stimulus data used to analyze the PassAct3 family of    %
% experiments. It uses markup defined by a header, as indicated by the comments  %
% below.                                                                         %
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% Comments are allowed at any point in the file.
%
% The first part of the file is a header which defines the markup.
%
% After the header, each line represents an item.  The columns become fields of that item.
% Each column has a type, which can be numerical or a string, or a spaceDelimTagged type.
%
% If a column type is spaceDelimTagged, then the value in that column is first split on spaces.
% Each sub-item within the column is placed into a list, and each has its own fields which are
% determined by the header.  These fields are delimited by / (slash).
%
% Fields can be either named or unnamed.  Unnamed fields are required for every sub-item.
% Named fields are optional.  '=' separates names from values for named tags.
%
% The columns entry in the header specifies what the column names and types are in the order of the columns.
%
% unnamed_field entries in the header are specified in the order in which they are expected.
% The unnamed_field entry is <column_name>:<structure_field_name>=<field_type>[:allowed values]
% column_name specifies which column the field belongs to.
% structure_field_name is the name used on the structure into which this file is parsed.
% field_type can be string or a numerical type
% You can restrict a field to draw its values from a closed set in order to ensure no typos
% occur in the this file.  In this case, follow the file_type by a ':' and a set of allowed values
% allowed values is a set of allowed values separated by commas and enclosed in curly braces.
% The closed set specifies the set of strings that are allowed in this file - it does not compare
% integer types to each other for instance
% Allowed values can also be converted from the file form if an -> is specified within the value
% e.g. a field value could be 's->sentence'.  In that case, 's' is used as the value in this file, but
% the parsed form will be 'sentence'.
% This is useful if you want a short form in the file to be parsed into a longer form, for instance.
%
% named_field entries are similar to unnamed_field entries.  The order in which they are specified
% is unimportant.  There are two differences from unnamed_field entries.
% file_field_name specifies the name used to indicate that field in this file.  By default, this is
% also used as the structure_field_name, but you can use the -> operator to use a different structure_field_name.
% The other difference is that the entry must end with the default value for the field.  sub-items which do not
% specify the named field will take the default value.
% <column_name>:<file_field_name>[->structure_field_name]=<field_type>[:allowed values];default=<defaultVal>
% sub-items which do not specify the named field will take the default value.
%
% It is possible to reference a different field's allowed values so that you don't need to create a
% (possibly large) closed set of allowed values twice.  To reference a different field's allowed values set
% the field_type to 'use_values_from' and specify which column field name combination to use separated by a '.'.
% The column you are using the values from can be the same column as the current field but does not have to be.
% For an unnamed_field entry this would like like:
% myColumnName:myField=use_values_from:someOtherColumn.someOtherField
%
% Finally, in addition to specifying the format for the latter part of the file, the header can include
% key value pairs that will be returned by the parser.  This can be used to add configuration that is
% defined at the experiment level rather than the item level.  The keys are always strings, the values
% can take numerical, boolean or string types.  To use a typed value, add an underscore with the type to
% the keyval specifier.  For example, to use a bool:
% keyval_bool:myBool=true
%
% The end of the header is indicated by a line with 5 stars: *****
